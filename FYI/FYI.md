## For Your Information (FYI)

**Problem Statement:**  Keeping up with all the birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, mother's and father's days and all the other important events in one's busy life can be challenging. Having forgotten some of these events in the past, I know how it feels :fearful:  
**Goal:**  Create a system that will never let us forget important events and upset our loved ones   
**MVP:**  A program that reminds us (by email) about events recorded in a pre-populated database. Including a webpage to enter new events  

**Approach:**   
1. Create a postgreSQL database
	* #People :family:
	* #Events :gift: :wedding: :mortar_board:
	* #Reminders :envelope:
	* #Solutions (nice to have)
2. Write a python code that would check if any reminders about events are due on the day, and if so, send it out
3. Design the webpage
4. Connect the python code to the webpage
5. Test test test
6. Deploy the product on Heroku-like service (nice to have)
