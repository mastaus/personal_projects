## Project Plan

**Problem Statement:**  Keeping up with all the birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, mother's and father's days and all the other important events in one's busy life can be challenging. Having forgotten some of these events in the past, I know how terrible it feels. 
**Goal:**  To create a system that would remind us of all the important events.
**MVP:**  A system that reminds us by email about events available in the prepopulated database. Including a webpage to enter new events.
**Approach:**   
1. Create a postgreSQL database
	* #People
	* #Reminders
	* #Events
	* #Gifts (nice to have)
2. Write a python code that would check if any reminders about events are due on the day, and if so, send it out.
3. Design the webpage
4. Connect the python code to the webpage
5. Test
6. Deploy the product on Heroku-like service
